Ingredients:

1. Fresh chicken
2. marinating items(cause I don't know what are the ingredients need to prepare that)
3. flour
4. mayonnaise
5. Tomato/Red chille sauce.

How to:

wash the chicken and marinate it over the night and then cook it by the fire.

Meanwhile prepare a rumali and apply mayonnaise and sauce 

Once the chicken is cooked cut the chicken into even smaller pieces and put them on the rumali and roll over to make a super tastier shawarma. 

The middle-east sensation is now in your hands. Enjoy!!
